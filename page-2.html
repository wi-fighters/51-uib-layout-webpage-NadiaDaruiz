                    My friend pushed on one of the outer doors. It swung inward, and he entered the building. Then,
                    before he could get to the next row of doors, he was distracted and turned around for an instant.
                    He didn’t realize it at the time, but he had moved slightly to the right. So when he came to the
                    next door and pushed it, nothing happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hmm,” he thought, “must be locked.” So he pushed the
                    side of the adjacent door. Nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Puzzled, my friend decided to go outside again. He turned around and pushed against the side of a
                    door.
                    Nothing. He pushed the adjacent door. Nothing. The door he had just entered no longer worked.
                    He turned around once more and tried the inside doors again. Nothing. Concern, then mild
                    panic. He was trapped! Just then, a group of people on the other side of the entranceway (to my
                    friend’s right) passed easily through both sets of doors. My friend hurried over to follow their
                    path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How could such a thing happen? A swinging door has two sides. One contains the supporting pillar and
                    the hinge, the other is unsupported. To open the door, you must push or pull on the unsupported
                    edge.
                    If you push on the hinge side, nothing happens. In my friend’s case, he was in a building where the
                    designer aimed for beauty, not utility. No distracting lines, no visible pillars, no visible hinges.
                    So how can the ordinary user know which side to push on?
                    While distracted, my friend had moved toward the (invisible) supporting pillar, so he was pushing
                    the doors on the hinged side.

                    No wonder nothing happened. Attractive doors. Stylish. Probably won a design prize.
                    Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding.
                    Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and
                    how to perform them?
                    Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all
                    the different controls and settings mean?
