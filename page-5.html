                <p>
                    Industrial design: The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications
                    that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of
                    both user and manufacturer (from the Industrial Design Society of America’s website).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interaction design: The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance
                    people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred.
                    Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a
                    positive, enjoyable experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experience design: The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments
                    with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience.
                    Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the
                    interaction between people and technology.
                    When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When done badly,
                    the products are unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation. Or they might be usable,
                    but force us to behave the way the product wishes rather than as we wish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Machines, after all, are conceived, designed, and constructed by people. By human standards,
                    machines are pretty limited.
                    They do not maintain the same kind of rich history of experiences that people have in
                    common with one another, experiences that enable
                    us to interact with others because of this shared understanding.
