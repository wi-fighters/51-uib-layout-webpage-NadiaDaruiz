                    Engineers, moreover, make the mistake of thinking that logical explanation is sufficient:
                    “If only people would read the instructions,” they say, “everything would be all right.”

                    Engineers are trained to think logically. As a result, they come to believe that all people must
                    think this way, and they design their machines accordingly.
                    When people have trouble, the engineers are upset, but often for the wrong reason.
                    “What are these people doing?” they will wonder. “Why are they doing that?” The problem
                    with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical.
                    We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish
                    it to be.

                    I used to be an engineer, focused upon technical requirements, quite ignorant of people. Even after
                    I switched into psychology and cognitive science, I still maintained my engineering emphasis
                    upon logic and mechanism.
                    It took a long time for me to realize that my understanding of human behavior was relevant
                    to my interest in the design of technology. As I watched people struggle with technology,
                    it became clear that the difficulties were caused by the technology, not the people.

                    I was called upon to help analyze the American nuclear power plant accident at Three Mile Island
                    (the island name comes from the fact that it is located on a river,
                    three miles south of Middle- town in the state of Pennsylvania).
                    In this incident, a rather simple mechanical failure was misdiagnosed. This led to several days of
                    difficulties and confusion, total destruction of the reactor, and a very close call to a severe
                    radiation release, all of which brought the American nuclear power industry to a complete halt.
                    The operators were blamed for these failures: “human error” was the immediate analysis.
                    But the committee I was on discovered that the plant’s control rooms were so
                    poorly designed that error was inevitable: design was at fault, not the operators.

                    The moral was simple: we were designing things for people, so we needed to understand both
                    technology and people. But that’s a difficult step for many engineers: machines
                    are so logical, so orderly. If we didn’t have people, everything would work so much better. Yup,
                    that’s how I used to think.
