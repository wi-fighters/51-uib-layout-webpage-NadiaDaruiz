                    Instead, machines usually follow rather simple, rigid rules of behavior. If we get the rules
                    wrong even slightly, the machine does what it is
                    told, no matter how insensible and illogical. People are imaginative and creative, filled with
                    common sense; that is, a lot of valuable knowledge built up over years of experience. But instead
                    of capitalizing on these strengths, machines require us to be precise and accurate,
                    things we are not very good at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Machines have no leeway or common sense. Moreover, many of the rules followed by a machine are known
                    only by the machine and its designers.
                    When people fail to follow these bizarre, secret rules, and the machine does the wrong thing, its
                    operators are blamed for not understanding the machine, for not following its rigid specifications.
                    With everyday objects, the result is frustration. With complex devices and commercial and industrial
                    processes, the resulting difficulties can lead to accidents, injuries, and even deaths.
                    It is time to reverse the situation: to cast the blame upon the machines and their
                    design. It is the machine and its design that are at fault. It is the duty of machines and those who
                    design them to understand people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.
                    The reasons for the deficiencies in human-machine interaction are numerous. Some come from the
                    limitations of today’s technology. Some come from self-imposed restrictions by the designers,
                    often to hold down cost. But most of the problems come from a complete lack of understanding
                    of the design principles necessary for effective human-machine interaction.
                    Why this deficiency? Because much of the design is done by engineers who are experts
                    in technology but limited in their understanding of people. “We are people ourselves,” they think,
                    “so we understand people.” But in fact, we humans are amazingly complex. Those who have not studied
                    human behavior often think it is pretty
                    simple.
