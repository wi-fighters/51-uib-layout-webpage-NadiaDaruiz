                    The doors in the story illustrate what happens when discoverability fails.
                    Whether the device is a door or a stove, a mobile phone or a nuclear power plant, the relevant
                    components must be visible, and they must communicate the correct message: What actions are
                    possible?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where and how should they be done? With doors that push, the designer must provide
                    signals that naturally indicate where to push. These need not destroy the aesthetics. Put a vertical
                    plate on the side to be pushed. Or make the supporting pillars visible. The vertical plate and
                    supporting pillars are natural signals, naturally interpreted,
                    making it easy to know just what to do: no labels needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With complex devices, discoverability and understanding require the aid of manuals or personal
                    instruction. We accept this if the device is indeed complex, but it should be unnecessary for simple
                    things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many products defy understanding simply because they have too many functions and controls.
                    I don’t think that simple home appliances—stoves, washing machines, audio and television sets
                    should look like Hollywood’s idea of a spaceship control room.
                    They already do, much to our consternation.
                </p>
                <p> Faced with a bewildering array of controls and displays, we simply memorize one or two fixed
                    settings to approximate what is desired.
                    In England I visited a home with a fancy new Italian washer dryer combination, with super-duper
                    multisymbol controls, all to do everything anyone could imagine
                    doing with the washing and drying of clothes. The husband (an engineering
                    psychologist) said he refused to go near it. The wife (a physician) said she had simply memorized
                    one setting and tried to ignore the rest. I asked to see the manual: it was just as confusing as the
                    device.
                    The whole purpose of the design is lost.
