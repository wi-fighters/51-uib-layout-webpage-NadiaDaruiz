            <h2>The Complexity of Modern Devices</h2>
            <section id="page-4">
                <p>
                    All artificial things are designed. Whether it is the layout of furniture in a room, the paths
                    through a garden or forest, or the intricacies of an electronic device,
                    some person or group of people had to decide upon the layout, operation, and mechanisms.
                    Not all designed things involve physical structures. Services, lectures,
                    rules and procedures, and the organizational structures of businesses and governments do not have
                    physical
                    mechanisms, but their rules of operation have to be designed, sometimes informally,
                    sometimes precisely recorded and specified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But even though people have designed things since prehistoric times, the field of design is
                    relatively new, divided into many areas of specialty.
                    Because everything is designed, the number of areas is enormous, ranging from clothes and
                    furniture to complex control rooms and bridges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This book covers everyday things, focusing on the interplay between
                    technology and people to ensure that the products actually fulfill human needs while being
                    understand- able and usable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the best of cases, the products should also be delightful and enjoyable, which means that not
                    only must the requirements of engineering, manufacturing, and ergonomics be satisfied,
                    but attention must be paid to the entire experience, which means the aesthetics of form and
                    the quality of interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The major areas of design relevant to this book are industrial design, interaction design, and
                    experience design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    None of the fields is well defined, but the focus of the efforts does vary, with industrial
                    designers emphasizing form and material, interactive designers emphasizing understandability and
                    usability, and experience designers emphasizing the emotional impact.
