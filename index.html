                    If I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, my inability to perform well would
                    neither
                    surprise nor bother me. But why should I have trouble with doors and light switches, water
                    faucets and stoves?
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Doors?” I can hear the reader saying. “You have trouble opening doors?” Yes. I push doors that
                    are meant to be pulled, pull doors that should be pushed, and walk into doors that neither pull nor
                    push, but slide.
                </p>
                <p> Moreover, I see others having the same troubles — unnecessary troubles. My problems with doors
                    have become so well known that confusing doors are often called “Norman doors.”
                    Imagine becoming famous for doors that don’t work right. I’m pretty sure that’s not
                    what my parents planned for me. (Put “Norman doors” into your favorite search engine —be sure to
                    include the quote marks: it makes for fascinating reading.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a
                    device as possible. There is not much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it. Suppose you
                    are in an office building, walking down a corridor. You come to a door.
                    How does it open? Should you push or pull, on the left or the right?
                    Maybe the door slides. If so, in which direction? I have seen doors that slide to the left,
                    to the right, and even up into the ceiling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The design of the door should indicate how to work it without any need for signs,
                    certainly without any need for trial and error.
                    A friend told me of the time he got trapped in the doorway of a post office in a European city.
                    The entrance was an imposing row of six glass swinging doors, followed immediately by a second,
                    identical row. That’s a standard design: it helps reduce the airflow and thus maintain the indoor
                    temperature of the building.
                    There was no visible hardware: obviously the doors could swing in either direction:
                    all a person had to do was push the side of the door and enter.
